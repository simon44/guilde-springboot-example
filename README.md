# Project #

This project is used to compare springboot and quarkus. It covers commons needs for an API : 
- CRUD endpoints, connected to a datasource
- **TODO** HttpClient to call an external API  
- **TODO** Secure resources access (here with basic authentication)
- Expose endpoints on a swagger-ui
